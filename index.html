	<p2>I am Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University. I also received my PhD degree in Political Science from Aarhus University and prior to entering the graduate program in Aarhus, I spent a year at the political science department at the University of California, San Diego.</p2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p2>My research focuses on how citizens make sense of relatively complex issues such as the state of the national economy. Inspired by work in social and political psychology, most of my work grapples with how and when citizens' partisan commitments influence their thinking about national economic conditions. Some of my work also addresses whether citizens' inferences about collective phenomena are guided by objective circumstances in their everyday lives.</p2>
