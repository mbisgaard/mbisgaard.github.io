	<p2>I am Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University and current holder of a Research Project-2 grant ($650,000) from the Independent Research Fund Denmark. I am also affiliated with the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley and I will usually be around Berkeley in January and August.</p2>

	<p2>My research lies at the intersection of political behavior, political psychology and political representation and it grapples with the electoral link between citizens and politicians. In my previous work, I have tried to understand how citizens' partisanship can impede their ability to hold politicians accountable and how much room politicians have in shaping public opinion. In my current work, I'm trying to understand how politicians think about voter behavior.</p2>
